## About the Project
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1gQxFhIRm0IarIo6sjHpi4oIvinL5UXOn)
<p>
Do you ever feel like you are spending too much money? Well, 50% of adults in Singapore do not have an idea on how much money they spend every month and roughly 70% of the population that track their monthly spendings usually don't overspend. </P>
<p>In order to combat the problem of overspending, Spendid was made.
With the features included in Spendid, we are aiming to help Singaporeans better manage their finances, by allowing them to track their daily expenses with ease.</p>

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
The shopping list feature that helps you plan what you need before shopping as people tend to unnecessarily buy more when they don’t make a list.  Start by creating a shopping cart and simply create a list of items you plan to buy. Also, if you’re unsure of the amount or if the price changes, you can always edit it or delete it as well.
This shopping list can be converted into a transaction that records the amount, along with the items bought and not bought.

## Recurring Entries

This feature reduces the tedious process of entering periodical payments such as subscriptions or salaries. Therefore, the Recurring Entry feature enables a hassle free user experience and give the users a peace of mind of not needing to worry that his subscriptions are not being recorded. It achieves this by automatically calculating and creating entries based on the planned payment and period.

## Daily Limit

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
The Daily Limit feature allows users to set a restriction on how much they can spend. If users were to go over this limit, the application would send out a warning to them. This feature aims to help more people to be able to stop themselves from overspending and is especially useful, since overspending occurs overtime, every single day, little by little, which can snowball into a huge amount.

## Encrypting Data
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19t27gN_Tqe6aR9BSMbinv1WASOOpetvs)
Data security is important for our users, that is why we have made use of industry standards encryption algorithms to provide this security. The standards used were AES256, RSA2048, and SHA256.

## Import and Export

For Spendid, we believe that users' transactions should be kept private, hence it is stored in your device and we do not data collected. That’s where Spendid allows you to backup your data to your preferred platform.
Also, importing your data is as easy as exporting it.

## Dark Theme

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
For an enhanced experience using the app. We have implemented a dark theme mode which has been proven to help conserve battery life for mobile devices with OLED and AMOLED screens.
As a result of the interface being mostly dark, this helps to reduce eye strain and minimize blue light for a better user experience.

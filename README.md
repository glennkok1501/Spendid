## About the Project
Do you ever feel like you are spending too much money? Well,  50% of adults in Singapore do not have an idea on how much money they spend every month and roughly 70% of the population that track their monthly spendings usually don't overspend. In order to combat the problem of overspending, Spendid was made.

With the <a href="#features">features</a> included in Spendid, we are aiming to help people better manage their finances, by allowing them to track their daily expenses with ease.
